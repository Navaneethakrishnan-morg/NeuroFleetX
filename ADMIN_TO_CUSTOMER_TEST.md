### 4. Customer View After Adding All

**Go to Customer Portal:**

```
┌─────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐
│ [🟢 AVAILABLE]      │  │ [🟡 IN USE]         │  │ [🟠 MAINTENANCE]    │  │ [🔴 OUT OF SERVICE] │
│ BMW M4              │  │ Tesla Model S       │  │ Toyota Camry        │  │ Honda Civic         │
│ [Book Now]          │  │ [Currently In Use]  │  │ [Under Maintenance] │  │ [Not Available]     │
└─────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘
    ✅ Clickable           ❌ Disabled            ❌ Disabled              ❌ Disabled
```

## Status Badge Colors

| Status | Badge Color | Button Text | Clickable? |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **AVAILABLE** | 🟢 Green | "Book Now" | ✅ Yes |
| **IN_USE** | 🟡 Yellow | "Currently In Use" | ❌ No |
| **MAINTENANCE** | 🟠 Orange | "Under Maintenance" | ❌ No |
| **OUT_OF_SERVICE** | 🔴 Red | "Not Available" | ❌ No |

## Expected Behavior Summary

### ✅ What Works:
1. Admin adds vehicle → Appears in Admin's Vehicle Management
2. Customer refreshes → Vehicle appears in Customer's Browse Vehicles
3. Status badge shows on every vehicle
4. Only AVAILABLE vehicles have green "Book Now" button
5. Other vehicles show disabled button with reason

### ✅ Real-Time Features:
- Vehicle count shows: "X vehicles found (Y available)"
- Status badges have animated pulse effect
- First AVAILABLE vehicle gets "✨ Recommended" tag
- Battery/Fuel level indicators for each vehicle
- Filters work (by type, electric/non-electric)

## Verification Checklist

**Before Testing:**
- [ ] Backend is running (check for "Started NeuroFleetXApplication")
- [ ] Frontend is running (check http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] Both are using latest code (backend rebuilt with `mvn clean package`)

**Admin Portal:**
- [ ] Can add vehicles
- [ ] Vehicles appear in Vehicle Management tab
- [ ] Can edit vehicle status
- [ ] Can delete vehicles

**Customer Portal:**
- [ ] Sees all vehicles admin added
- [ ] Status badge visible on each vehicle
- [ ] Green "Book Now" for AVAILABLE vehicles
- [ ] Gray disabled button for other statuses
- [ ] Filter by type works
- [ ] Filter by electric works
- [ ] Vehicle count is correct

## Troubleshooting

### Customer sees no vehicles:
1. **Check Backend:** Is it running with latest code?
   ```bash
   # Stop and restart:
   Ctrl+C
   start-backend.bat
   ```

2. **Check Admin First:** Login as admin, verify vehicles exist in Vehicle Management

3. **Clear Browser Cache:** Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Ctrl+F5

4. **Check Console:** F12 → Console tab, look for errors

### Customer sees old data:
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5`
- Or clear localStorage and login again

### Status not showing:
- Make sure you set the status when adding vehicle
- Default is AVAILABLE if not set
- Refresh customer portal after admin changes

## API Endpoints Used

**Admin Adds Vehicle:**
```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/vehicles
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```

**Customer Views Vehicles:**
```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/customer/vehicles
Authorization: Bearer <customer-token>
```

**Both use the same vehicle data!** ✅

## Database Check (Optional)

To verify vehicles are saved:

1. Visit: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
2. JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
3. User: `sa`, Password: (blank)
4. Query:
```sql
SELECT id, vehicle_number, model, status 
FROM vehicles 
ORDER BY id DESC;
```

You should see all vehicles admin added!

## Summary

🎯 **Goal Achieved:**
- Admin adds vehicle → Customer sees it immediately
- Status is clearly visible on each vehicle
- Customers can only book AVAILABLE vehicles
- Everything else is view-only

🚀 **Ready to Test:**
1. Restart backend (if needed)
2. Login as Admin
3. Add your BMW M4 with Status = AVAILABLE
4. Login as Customer
5. See BMW M4 with green [AVAILABLE] badge
6. Click "Book Now" to make a booking!
